I just copied this from the Classmate's Program Files...... it seems to work :-(

You know where WPI conveniently hid all of the files for WPIJavaCV and NetworkTable etc etc etc?
They're not "on" the regular website, you have to download an SVN client and also make an account on FIRSTForge
to get the files. And I don't really think they told anyone about this.... I found all of this out on Chiefdelphi
